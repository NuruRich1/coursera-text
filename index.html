	<div id="chicken"><h3>Jollof</h3>
     Jollof rice, or sometimes called Jellof rice, is a classic rice dish cooked in a flavorful tomato-based broth with its several regional variations in name and ingredients. It is originated from West Africa, however it has gained world recognition hence can be found in other parts of the world due to its nutrient benefits. There are numerous reasons Jollof Rice is my favourite delicacy. The major ones: its nutritious and tasty flavor.jJollof can be served in party, hotel, resturant, and many more. What are you waiting for? Look for online resources and prepare yummy jollof rice.
     Jollof rice packs a powerful punch in the taste stakes, but its origins are a point of contention with many African nations claiming it as their own. So much so that online wars are ongoing to protect it.
     In West Africa, sacred Jollof rice is a fragrant dish that is revered across the sub-region for its unique sweet taste and subtle spiciness. It is also the source of heated discussion online among Nigerians, Ghanaians and Senegalese as to who owns the bragging rights to the dish. However, in order to understand the magic of Jollof or who can rightfully lay claim to it, first its history must be understood.
     Jollof is believed to have originated in the Senegambia region of West Africa among the Wolof people, where it is known as benachin. The mouth-watering meal has travelled throughout the sub-region because of the frequent cultural exchange that goes on there. As such, it has evolved into several regional varieties, laced with the heritage of the place where it is prepared. Nevertheless, it maintains its magic and is relished all over Africa.

	<div id="chicken"><h3>Banku</h3>
     Banku is a local Ghanaian dish prepared by mixing a proportionate amount of fermented corn dough and cassava dough. These dough types are mixed together in hot water in a consistency that favours the maker. That sounds like a whole lot of starch and carbs if you ask us but banku has more to offer.
     The corn dough dishes out some fibre, minerals and magnesium together with complex carbs. The cassava dough is rich in starch which is good for the body, in the right proportions of course.
     Banku can be served with soups and stews alike.
     Ghana-based Nigerian musician Mr. Eazi’s Bankulize illustrates the fundamental fondness that people attach to this satisfyingly ‘sticky’ meal that brings people together. Banku with fried fish and ground pepper, grilled tilapia, avocado in tomato sauce, and with okro soup/stew and crab are some of the dishes found on restaurants’ menus that serve this scrumptious meal.
     Cooking banku involves constantly stirring the soluble mixture of a proportional blend of fermented corn and cassava dough as it dissolves in water boiling over hot charcoal or a stove. A banku-based meal is nutritious and quite uncomplicated to prepare if you know what you’re doing.
     At the annual local food expo Chow Festival in June, you can sample the best of Accra’s traditional plates including banku. Local chop bars located in every neighbourhood as well as popular restaurants like Duncans in Osu, It’s My Kitchen and Cozys in Kumasi, and Ayi Banku’s Bar in Tamale also serve banku.

	<div id="chicken"><h3>Waakye</h3>
    If Jollof Rice is the superman of Ghanaian food, Banku the batman then Waakye has got to be spiderman. Together these three are what you’d find readily available in every foodie nook and cranny in Ghana. These are the superheroes who wield extraordinary power over the culinary heritage of Ghana. Again like Jollof, Waakye is best enjoyed in a restaurant or as street food and like other rice and beans combos it has the unique characteristic of providing you with both carbohydrate and protein. Waakye can be found in almost every street hence you can't resist its aroma.
    Waakye, a dish made from beans and rice, is a familiar sight to most Ghanaians. This simple, nutritious meal can be found on sale all over the country, from restaurants to street food stalls. But how did it actually come to be?
    Who makes the best jollof rice: Ghanaians or Nigerians? This simple question forms the basis of the Jollof Wars, in which citizens of these nations take to social media to debate whose rendition of this originally Senegalese dish tastes best. Although there’s no actual fight, the banter and jokes can get intense, with national pride at stake.
    However, there’s another meal that Ghanaians love just as much as jollof, but which they’re probably just trying to keep away from Nigerians. It’s called waakye.
    Waakye (pronounced ‘waachay’) is a combination of red or black-eyed beans and rice, and it’s often served with salads, spaghetti, fried plantains, garri, meat and fish. It’s a delicacy all over the country, and Ghanaians frequently queue at stalls to buy it for their breakfast or lunch.
    Waakye originated from northern Ghana, where rice and beans are staple food crops. However, it’s not clear which specific ethnic group is responsible for pioneering this national treasure. Depending on where it’s prepared, certain variations exist in its ingredients, like the ratio of rice to beans or the spiciness of the accompanying shitor (hot pepper sauce). Nevertheless, it manages to maintain a generally consistent taste.
