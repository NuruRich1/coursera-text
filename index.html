                    Jollof rice, or sometimes called Jellof rice, is a classic rice dish cooked in a flavorful tomato-based broth with its several regional variations in name and ingredients. It is originated from West Africa, however it has gained world recognition hence can be found in other parts of the world due to its nutrient benefits. There are numerous reasons Jollof Rice is my favourite delicacy. The major ones: its nutritious and tasty flavor.jJollof can be served in party, hotel, resturant, and many more.

                <h2>Banku</h2>
                <p>
                    Banku is a local Ghanaian dish prepared by mixing a proportionate amount of fermented corn dough and cassava dough. These dough types are mixed together in hot water in a consistency that favours the maker. That sounds like a whole lot of starch and carbs if you ask us but banku has more to offer.
                    The corn dough dishes out some fibre, minerals and magnesium together with complex carbs. The cassava dough is rich in starch which is good for the body, in the right proportions of course.
                    Banku can be served with soups and stews alike.

                <h2>Waakye</h2>
                <p>
                    If Jollof Rice is the superman of Ghanaian food, Banku the batman then Waakye has got to be spiderman. Together these three are what youâ€™d find readily available in every foodie nook and cranny in Ghana. These are the superheroes who wield extraordinary power over the culinary heritage of Ghana. Again like Jollof, Waakye is best enjoyed in a restaurant or as street food and like other rice and beans combos it has the unique characteristic of providing you with both carbohydrate and protein. Waakye can be found in almost every street hence you can't resist its aroma.
